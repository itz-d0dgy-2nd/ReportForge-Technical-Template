# Calculated severity matrix is used to determine finding severity based on the intersection of impact and likelihood
# - Displayed in the severity assessment table in the report
# - Defines and controls the severity matrix layout in the reports severity assessment
# - Defines and controls the severity names used in the findings markdown YAML front matter
# - Severity names (Low, Medium, High, Critical) map to CSS classes for colour styling
#   If these severity names change, you must update the corresponding CSS classes in template.css
